**Description**:
Turtle Defense is a tower defense game developed in Unity, inspired by games like *Plants vs. Zombies*. In this game, players defend their territory from waves of enemies by strategically placing plants and other defensive items on a grid. Each item has unique abilities and strengths, helping to hold off a variety of enemies advancing from one side of the screen.

## Gameplay

- **Resource Management**: Players can allocate funds for battle or leave some in the bank. Winning a battle increases the funds in the bank through interest, while losing results in a loss of the allocated battle funds.
- **Tower Defense Strategy**: Choose from various defensive plants and items to place on the grid. Each unit has distinct strengths and weaknesses, allowing for strategic planning to counter different enemy types.
- **Enemies and Waves**: The enemies range from basic attackers to tougher foes, each requiring a unique approach to defeat.
- **Auto-scaling Mechanic**: Some units are protected by an automatic revival feature. When these units are defeated, they will respawn, providing ongoing defense.

## Controls

- Use the **ESC** key to pause the game and access additional options.

## Starting Resources

- Players start with a default region and resource allocation, which can be adjusted as they progress.

## Visual Elements

The game features vibrant, pixel-art graphics with a tropical theme, set on a beach with palm trees and ocean views. The characters and enemies are visually distinct, helping players quickly identify threats and deploy defenses effectively.

**This game combines resource management and tower defense mechanics to create an engaging, strategic experience. Can you defend the beach and keep the enemies at bay?**
